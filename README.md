Anton's OpenSCAD library
========================

Because every OpenSCAD ~~programmer~~designer has their own library.

As anyone with a Java background I recognize the authority of internationally
viable namespacing. For that reason I refer to the parts in this library in my
designs as *se/antoneliasson/thing.scad* and thus recommend that you install
it into your local OpenSCAD library path like this:

	$ git clone https://github.com/antoneliasson/antonscad ~/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries/se/antoneliasson

assuming that you are on a Linux system.
